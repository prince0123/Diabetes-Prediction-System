# Diabetes-Prediction-System
📊 About the Dataset:
The dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, aiming to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. It comprises various variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more, with 'Outcome' as the dependent variable.

🛠️ Project Steps:

Step 1: Understanding the dataset and its predictive analysis potential. This involved partitioning the data into independent and dependent variables, crucial for our predictive model.

Step 2: Setting up the environment by installing necessary packages like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and model building.

Step 3: Importing important libraries and loading the dataset into our environment. We checked for missing values and visualized correlations among variables.

Step 4: Setting up the project environment using PyCharm and Django for web application development.

Step 5: Designing the front-end and prediction pages for our application, integrating with the back-end for seamless functionality.

Step 6: Finalizing the project setup and running the application locally to ensure everything works smoothly.

🎯 Key Learnings:

Hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and web application development.
Enhanced understanding of predictive analysis and its applications in healthcare.
Strengthened skills in Python, machine learning, and web development frameworks like Django.
